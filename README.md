autoprint
=========

Grabs email from gmail and prints every message with Google Cloud Print.

Currently there is a bug where it can only send it to Google Docs and comes up with a generic "error" when trying to print on a real printer. However when printing the script's output via the cloud print web interface it works.
If anyone has some insight that would be great.
